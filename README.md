## Jets Project

### Week 2 Homework for Skill Distillery - Jets

#### Description
This project creates a fleet of WWII-era planes with different capabilities. The user is presented with a menu to 
access information on the various planes, including listing all planes, reviewing the fastest one one with the longest range, and adding their own plane. The very smart user simply types a listed number to choose a <strong>listed</strong> option. For the "quit" option, I used some code I found on StackOverflow.  <em>Project is a nod to Dad.</em> 

#### Technologies used
Objects, interfaces, loops through arrays

#### Lessons learned
I'm still not 100% getting the creating of the various classes. I understand the concept of breaking things down into smaller bits, but without the UML provided I probably wouldn't have created as many classes as I did.
